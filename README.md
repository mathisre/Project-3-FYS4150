Earth-Sun Euler and Verlet include the algorithms for just the Sun-Earth system using Earth initial conditions (x,y,v_x,v_y)=(0,1,-2pi,0). Both of them read files and number of points from the command line. Both of them also use armadillo. 

The object oriented code initializes planet objects and adds them to the solver. The verlet solver creates verleto.txt that includes the positions of all the planets. The prgoram also runs a mercury sun two-body planet with the GR correction. That creates perihelion.txt that creates the perihelion angle and the time. Finally the code also runs Forward Euler and it creates a eulero.txt file. 

Hey sorry I didn't include a proper conclusion. Had a lot to do but that didn't happen. That's my bad.
